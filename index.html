        <h2>Welcome to my corner of the digital world!</h2>
        <br>
I’m Michelle, a Software Developer, with a diverse professional background and a passion for problem-solving.
My career journey has been a dynamic blend of industries and roles. From the vibrant hustle of the hospitality sector to the strategic realm of banking, and the innovative pulse of e-commerce, I've worn many hats—each one enriching my skill set and broadening my perspective. My experience spans Account Management, Customer Experience and Sales, equipping me with a well-rounded understanding of business operations and client relations.
<br>
<h2>What drives you Michelle?</h2>
Currently, I’m channeling my curiosity and analytical skills into a new venture: Software Development. I believe that creating effective solutions for others is where true impact happens. This belief has driven me to delve into the world of coding, where I’m enhancing my problem-solving capabilities and technical expertise.
I’m proficient in a range of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, MySQL, and Python. Each of these tools represents a piece of the puzzle that allows me to build intuitive and efficient solutions. My goal is to merge my business acumen with my growing technical skills to craft innovative software solutions that make a difference.
<br>
<h2>What are you upto when not coding?</h2>
<br>
When I’m not coding or strategizing, you’ll find me exploring new technologies, brainstorming creative solutions, or diving into a good book. I’m excited to leverage my diverse background and passion for technology to tackle new challenges and contribute to impactful projects.
